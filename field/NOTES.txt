. Trying to understand any trade-offs between pointers and interfaces
. An interface instance is pointer-like but slightly larger
.. based on this experiement:

	xx := TestElement{}
	println(unsafe.Sizeof(xx)) // 40 bytes
	println(unsafe.Sizeof(&xx)) // 8 bytes
	var yy Element = &xx
	println(unsafe.Sizeof(yy)) // 16 bytes

. Size of the interface does not depend on number of methods - as would be expected
